## INTJ

Knowledge is densely restricted to a few particular fields/subjects, with mastery as a primary focus. Despite the existence of a small knowledge base (especially for INTJs with consume last), strong intuition enables existing sensory data to be forgotten or ignored completely when conclusions are able to be connected via empirical reasoning. Practicality and applicability to the real world ("what makes the most sense?/what solution is the most efficient?") are prioritized over the obtainment of surface level knowledge and experiences, although this often results in a significant lack of comfort and familiarity with everyday situations (especially those that involve other people).

## INTP

Knowledge is sparsely distributed throughout a wide variety of subjects, with exhaustion being the primary focus. A wide variety of loose connections between facts (e.g. history, philosophy, etc.) and experiences (e.g. world of warcraft) are then established deductively in order to form an understanding of "what is" largely with regards to the world. Understanding is valued over practicality ("what are all of the possibilities?/what are all of the possible solutions?"), which often leads INTPs to struggle to find an area of passion or expertise. Still however, they are able to connect with other people via their likes and interests, and describe a particular opinion they have about a shared field of interest (of which there are very many, which is also why INTPs are very good at trivia) by providing lots of connections between external data to support a specific opinion about it.

## ISFP

A deep inner world is established via the obtainment of a wide variety of perceptions and experiences within the world. New experiences are bridged via a flexible feeling state (especially Fi-F), and pools of intuition form to establish a (nonverbal) connection between ideas. Subconscious processing can take its time, but eventually forms nearly a direct connection between details and feeling state (perhaps also why isfp is cited as a common type associated with schizophrenia). Given that intuition and ideas form subconsciously as a result of emotion and specific areas of focus, this type can also often come across in a very "head in the clouds," standoffish, or selfish manner. Reasoning won't immediately be addressed, and conversations involving other people's emotions and/or paranoia are likely to be left very one-sided, which can lead to accumulated frustration from others and eventually abandonment as a result of feeling misunderstood.
